# slush
**s**illy **l**ittle **u**nderdeveloped **sh**ell

## What?
This is a shell that I am making just to test myself and get a better understanding of the concepts it involves, such as forking, piping and bits of low-level memory management. It is by no means extraordinary or special and it is fiercely underdeveloped. It's also not greatly robust, nor does it offer any amazing features. It just does what it says on the tin... just about.

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/fl3ur/slush.git
cd slush
make
./slush
```

## Customisation
There's not yet any equivalent to a bash profile (sorry!) but I'm working on it! (maybe!)

## To-do list
* variables
* interpret keypress (e.g arrow keys, tab)
* command and argument autocomplete
* initialisation from profile
* globbing
* redirecting stdout to files
